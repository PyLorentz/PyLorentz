Additionally, many samples will be on a substrate or membrane of some sort which we can account for while assuming it is of uniform thickness.

The simulation area is a grid of size (1,500,500) with cubic voxels of length 5nm. The in-plane component of the magnetization is depicted with the same colorwheel we will use to show the final simulated integrated magnetic induction map, which serves to highlight how the output of a micromagnetics simulation is _not_ what you will observe in the microscope. The micrscope views (and TIE reconstructs) the integrated magnetic induction along the beam direction, and this can look very different from the magnetization. \n",

HSV wheels intrinsically have 3-fold emphasis (three primary and three secondary colors), but you can also use a 4-fold colorwheel by setting hsvwheel=False in the \"show_im()\" command. The matter of creating a \"good\" disc colormap which shows both azimuth and magnitude in a perceptually uniform way is not simple; more can be read about colormaps [in this paper by Peter Kovesi and on his website](https://peterkovesi.com/projects/colourmaps/)."

Subsequent runs will be much faster, taking ~0.09 seconds for (1,64,64) and ~1.6 seconds for (1,128,128) arrays on a moderately powerful 8-core laptop. The total computation time of course depends on your cpu speed and number of cores, along with the image size and number of nonzero voxels.
