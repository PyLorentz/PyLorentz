    "In this notebook we demonstrate solving the transport of intensity equation (TIE) and finding magnetic induction from an experimental through focal series (tfs) of TEM images. For more information please check out our [wiki/documentation pages](https://pylorentztem.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). \n",

    "If you have never used a Jupyter Notebook before we recommend familiarizing yourself with the [notebook basics](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Notebook/Notebook%20Basics.html). While Python knowledge is not strictly required for running PyLorentz code, a certain familiarity is helpful for understanding how to modify the examples to suit your needs. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is ready to be run as-is. The first time, however, you will need to download the example data. This can be done through the notebook and is demonstrated below. Cells can be executed by selecting and pressing ``shift + enter``, and you can proceed with running all of the cells in order. The python docstrings for these functions can be found on the wiki, but are also viewable in Jupyter. E.g. for the TIE() function, executing a cell containing: `?TIE` will pull up the documentation for that function. \n",
    "\n",
    "All of the features available in this notebook are also available in the TIE GUI, which additionally contains processes for aligning experimental datasets. For details on running that please refer to the README in the ``Pylorentz/GUI/`` directory. \n",
