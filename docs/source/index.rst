PyLorentz
=====================================
`PyLorentz <https://github.com/PyLorentz/PyLorentz>`_ is a codebase designed for analyzing Lorentz Transmission Electron Microscopy (LTEM) data. There are three primary features and functions: 

- PyTIE -- Reconstructing the magnetic induction from LTEM images using the Transport of Intensity Equation (TIE)
- SimLTEM -- Simulating phase shift and LTEM images from a given magnetization 
- GUI/Align -- Aligning raw LTEM images so they can be reconstructed and providing a GUI for PyTIE
