PyLorentz
=====================================
`PyLorentz <https://github.com/PyLorentz/PyLorentz>`_ is a codebase designed for analyzing Lorentz Transmission Electron Microscopy (LTEM) data. There are two primary features and functions:

- Phase reconstruction -- Reconstructing the electron phase shift from LTEM images using either the transport of intensity equation (TIE) or automatic differentiation (AD) based methods
- SimLTEM -- Simulating the electron phase shift and LTEM images from a given magnetization configuration, such as that created by micromagnetic simulations.
