Micromagnetics References
----------------------------------------

The simulation side of PyLorentz begins with the output of micromagnetic simulations. PyLorentz has been tested with `OOMMF <https://math.nist.gov/oommf/>`_ and `Mumax <https://mumax.github.io/>`_; we recommend you refer to their documentation pages for background and information on setting up your own micromagnetic simulations.

There is also `Ubermag <https://ubermag.github.io/>`_, a project that interfaces with both OOMMF and Mumax allowing one to run micromagnetic simulations though Python in Jupyter notebooks. It has helpful display functionalities and makes it easier to begin using micromagnetics without learning the scripting languages.

For those wanting to get started with OOMMF or Ubermag, the Online Spintronics Seminar Series presented a series of `video tutorials <https://www.spintalks.org/tutorials>`_ that are very helpful.
